I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in compilers and runtime systems in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. I am a member of the [Compiler and Architecture Design Group (CArD)](http://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/compilers/), the [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/), and a visiting member of staff at the [School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/).
	
Before joining the faculty in Edinburgh I was a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Prior to that I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/). I received my PhD from the [University of MÃ¼nster](http://www.wwu.de/en) in Germany.
