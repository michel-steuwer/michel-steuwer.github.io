I am a professor at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin) and lead the chair of Compilers and Programming Languages. I am a member of the [Institute of Software Engineering and Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.tu.berlin/en/eecs/institutions/institutes/institute-of-software-engineering-and-theoretical-computer-science) in the [Faculty IV – Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.tu.berlin/en/eecs) at TU Berlin.

Before joining TU Berlin, I was a lecturer (assistant professor) in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/), a lecturer at the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh. I received my PhD from the [University of Münster](http://www.wwu.de/en) in Germany.
