The team project is an integral and distinctive part of any Glasgow Computing Science degree.
It allows students to experience first hand the many issues concerning effective teamwork as well as the various phases of the software lifecycle in some depth.

I am teaching this course together with Dr. Tim Storer (Course Coordinator), Dr. Inah Omoronyia, and Professor Joemon Jose.
