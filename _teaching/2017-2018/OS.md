The aims of the Operating Systems course are:

 - to introduce the students to the basic concepts and abstraction models for Operating Systems;
 - to show the range of algorithms and methodologies available for specific problems in an Operating System, the implications of selecting specific algorithms, and to critically assess their performance and behaviour;
 - to develop an integrated understanding of what a computing machine and resource is performing, from a holistic view of hardware and software;
 - to convey knowledge of the family of algorithms dealing with: scheduling, process management, deadlock management, synchronisation, and key advances in distributed operating systems.

I am teaching this course together with Dr. Wim Vanderbauwhede.
