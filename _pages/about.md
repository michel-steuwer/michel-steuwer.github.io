I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in compilers and runtime systems in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) in Scotland.
I am a member of the [Compiler and Architecture Design Group (CArD)](http://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/compilers/), the [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/), and a visiting member of staff at the [School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/).

Before joining the faculty in Edinburgh I was a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk).
Prior to that I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).
I received my PhD from the [University of MÃ¼nster](http://www.wwu.de/en) in Germany.


Research Focus
------

I am interested in all aspects of parallel programming.
Particular research interests of mine include _performance portability_, _structured parallel programming_, _heterogeneous and GPU computing_, and _novel compilation techniques for high-level languages_.

<!-- PhD opportunities
------
I am looking for talented students with a strong interest in practical and/or theoretical aspects of parallel programming for pursuing a PhD.
If your are interested, please drop me an [email](contact) describing your experiences and research interests. -->


What is parallel programming and why is it important?
------
Computers have become more and more powerful by increasingly complex designs where many computations can happen at the same time in parallel.
Virtually every computer from the tiny once in your smartphone to the extreme large once filling entire data centres are nowadays _parallel_.
Programming these computers and making efficient use of them is much more difficult than it was for traditional computers.

I am researching methodologies and techniques to _simplify_ the development of software which makes _efficient_ use of the computer hardware.
This research is fundamental for our ability to tackle many important and complex applications ranging from the artificial intelligence which makes your smartphone _smart_ and which will drive our cars up to complex scientific simulations which enhance our understanding of climate change.
